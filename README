wlktr is simply a C function that walks a directory tree. As it traverses the
directory tree, it can examine specific types of files that the user
specified, and can also perform actions upon them.

This function requires only 2 parameters: the name of the root directory to
start in, and an array of structures that specify an action to perform on
specific types of files:

int wlktr(const char *root, wlktr_action_t *actions);

More info can be found in the wlktr header file.
